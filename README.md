## 🗺 Project Layout

- [`components`](/packages) All the source code for the Unimodules, if you want to edit a library or just see how it works this is where you'll find it.
- [`assets`](/apps) This is where you can find Expo projects which are linked to the development Unimodules. You'll do most of your testing in here.
